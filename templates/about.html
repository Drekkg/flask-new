<h2>About Page</h2>
<p>The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
    recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when Smaug
    came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf
    decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf
    also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The
    superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other
    business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.</p>

        <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
        <p>
            Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to the Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his
            youth, Thorin and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug, in TA
            2770. While in exile, he quickly grew into a capable warrior. This was demonstrated at the Battle of
            Azanulbizar, near Moria, in TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath Moria's East-gate, and
            at some point in the battle, his shield broke, and, using an oaken tree branch found on the ground as a
            shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which remained with him even in death.[2]

            Thorin became King-in-Exile of Durin's Folk in TA 2850, after his father went missing and died in the
            dungeons of Dol Guldur.

        <h3>Kili and Fili</h3>
        <p>
            Fíli and Kíli were Dwarvern brothers and were also the youngest of the thirteen Dwarves who set out with
            Thorin Oakenshield's company, along with Gandalf and Bilbo Baggins, to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the
            dragon Smaug.

            Fíli and Kíli were the two most active Dwarves of Thorin's company, and, apart from Balin and possibly
            Bombur, they appear more frequently as "individual" characters in J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit than the rest
            of Thorin's companions, who are most often named only in group-reference.

        <h3>Oin</h3>
        <p>
            Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Óin's uncle was Fundin,
            the father of Balin and Dwalin.

            Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined Thorin's
            company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain, wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves who
            bet that Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were
            usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company, as they were the most skilled of the group. He
            fought in and survived the Battle of Five Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain with King Dáin II
            Ironfoot, along with many other Dwarves of the company of Thorin.

            Ring.
